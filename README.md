In this chapter, we discussedthe logical operators &&, || and !.De
Morgan’slawscan sometimesmakeitmoreconvenient forustoexpress alogical expression. These
laws statethatthe expression !( condition1 && condition2 ) is logically equivalent to theexpression
(!condition1 || !condition2 ).Also,the expression !( condition1 || condition2 ) is logically equiv-
alenttothe expression (!condition1 && !condition2 ).Use De Morgan’s laws to write equivalent
expressions for each of thefollowing,thenwriteaprogramtoshowthatthe original expression and
thenew expression in each case areequivalent:
a) !( x<5)&&!(y>=7)
b) !( a==b)|| !( g!=5)
c) !( (x<=8)&&(y>4))
d) !( (i>4)||(j<= 6 ))
